 * app doesn't require listing every location in the restaurant
 * group. Instead, use the geolocation reducer to query locations
 * based on User input, then after a selection, use pushGeolocation
 * to add that geolocation object to the locations reducer.  This should
 * make your app very happy and save a big non-discrete request as the
 * restaurant business grows in location data
